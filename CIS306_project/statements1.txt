If I write an exam and I cheat then I will get caught and I will fail
If I write an exam and I cheat then I will get caught and I will fail
If I write an exam then I will get caught and I will fail
If the moon is made of cheese then basketballs are round
If spiders have eight legs then Sam walks with a limp
If it's your birthday or there will be cake then there will be cake
If it's raining then it will not be tuesday
If im not happy then I will be sad
If I got paid and I didn't break my leg then I am not mark twain
